# Disable Microsoft Personal Data Collection Telemetry Services
<p>If you install Windows 10 Home on its default settings, the operating system sends data about your internet browser history and your location, tracks every word you type on the keyboard using a keylogger and notes every single request and question you ask of the personal assistant Cortana â€“ in part to serve targeted advertisements to you in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>Microsoft have even rolled out back ports of the tracking "services" to Windows 8 and Windows 7.</p>
