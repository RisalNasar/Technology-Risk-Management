# Authentication Factors - Can Passwords Be Totally Replaced?

<p>There are three ways, in which a person can be authenticated to a system:
	<ul>
		<li>Based on What You Know. Example: Passwords and Passphrases.</li>
		<li>Based on What You Have. Example: Mobile Phones, Hardware Token, etc.</li>
		<li>Based on What You Are. Example: Fingerprint, Retina Scan, Palm Print, Face Recognition, etc.</li>
	</ul>


<p> Even though, password controls are often weak due to people using simple, easy to guess, repetitive passwords, passwords have their own merit in that they are something the user knows and can choose not to reveal to somebody.  However, the other two authentication factors (What You Are and What You Have) could be forcefully used without the consent of the user (example: While the user is unconscious, asleep or after physically overpowering the user).
