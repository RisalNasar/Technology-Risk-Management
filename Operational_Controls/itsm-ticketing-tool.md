# Best Practices for IT Service Management (ITSM) Ticketing Tool

<p>A few best practices in the implementation of ITSM ticketing tool:

<ul>
	<li> All fields in the ITSM Tool should be searchable through the Tool, so that data could be pulled out to satisfy audit requirements.
	<li> ITSM Tool should have the capability to indicate Implementer Queue so that Requesters can directly assign work to the Implementer team, who would be responsible for carrying out the work.
	<li> Only if Implementer team is not readily known, should the ITSM ticket be assigned to a Helpdesk Queue, who would study the ticket request and route the ticket to the appropriate Implementer Queue.

</ul>
