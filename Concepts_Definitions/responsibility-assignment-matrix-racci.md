# <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Responsibility Assignment Matrix - RACCI Matrix</strong></span></p>
<p>The Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACCI Matrix) describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverable for a project or business process.  It is especially useful in clarifying roles and responsibilities in cross-functional/departmental projects and processes.</p>
<p><strong>Responsible (Recommender / Driver / Performer) - </strong>Those responsible for the performance of the task. There should be exactly one person with this assignment for each task.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Accountable (Final Approving Authority)  - </strong>The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Consulted (Contributor / Counsel) - </strong>Those whose opinions are sought; and with whom there is two-way communication.</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong> - The person/function reviewing the result of the activity (other than the accountable). He or she has a right of veto; his or her advice is binding.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Informed - </strong>Those who are kept up-to-date on progress; and with whom there is one-way communication.</p>
