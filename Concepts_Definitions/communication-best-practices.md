# Communication Best Practices
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Communication Channels</strong></span></p>
<p>In the order of effectiveness of general communication:  Face-to-face &gt; Phone call &gt; Email.</p>
<p>Complex Ideas: Layout idea in a PowerPoint/Word/Excel Document, communicate through email and follow up with Face-to-face or Phone call presentation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Meeting Minutes</strong></span></p>
<p>If the points discussed and decisions taken are important, follow up after the meeting with a meeting minutes to have everything recorded in black-and-white.  If the details discussed are not so important, or if their is already a strong drive for proper controls being included in the project, then do not sweat the small details (no need to capture in black-and-white, and spend the time on more important tasks).</p>
<p>Capture all the IT Security and Risk related discussion and decision points for a project in one single document for central tracking.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></span></p>
<p>Always ensure that written communication is "toned down" and is highlighting the best of intentions.  Any conflict should be resolved through a face-to-face meeting or through a phone conversation.</p>
