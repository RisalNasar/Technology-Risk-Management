# Are Risk Management Methodologies Useful?

<p>I would like to bring your attention to be this guidances from the government of UK: <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analysis-of-information-risk-management-methodologies'>https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analysis-of-information-risk-management-methodologies</a>

<p>The above was a guidance comparing the different Risk Management Frameworks.  The above guidance was withdrawn by the Government of UK on the 18th of May, 2016, replacing it with this guidance: <a href='https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/critical-appraisal-risk-methods-and-frameworks'>https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/critical-appraisal-risk-methods-and-frameworks</a>

<p>The content of the new guidance highlights the limitations of a matrices based risk management framework which might remove natural cognitive thought from the risk assessment process.

<p>The main points, out of the many, from the guidance are:

<h3>Abstraction through labelling</h3>

<p>Risk methods and frameworks use labels to name, number, order and measure the components of risk. This act of labelling introduces a layer of abstraction which can conceal the subtlety and complexity of risk. As a result, the necessary context for meaning is lost, and it becomes more difficult to arrive at a consistent understanding. In addition, the type of labels used in risk management can promote bias in practitioners and decision makers.

<h3>The limits of using matrices</h3>

<p>Many risk methods and frameworks use matrices to combine the input of risk components to produce risk values or statements. Prior work has shown that, though convenient and quick to use, using matrices to produce outputs that inform management decisions can belie the complexity of technology systems, and therefore the true nature of the risks associated with them. Matrices can hide the function used to combine input components; this makes it difficult for the validity of the risk output to be determined. Additionally, the function used can vary, resulting in inconsistency of risk outputs. For example, two different matrices could combine risk components in different ways, yet produce identical-looking risk outputs both labelled 'high’.

<p>Furthermore, the use of linear scales for risk inputs and outputs in matrices can obscure the non-linear nature of risks that are affected by determining factors such as time. A ‘high’ risk, for example, may not be proportionally more severe than a ‘medium-high’ risk than a ‘medium-high’ risk is to a ‘medium’ risk.
