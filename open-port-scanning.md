# Port Scanning - Firewall Best Practices
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Port Scanning</span></p>
<p>Use <a href="https://www.grc.com/shieldsup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GRC's ShieldsUP Port Scanning tool</a> to find out if any ports have been opened through your firewall or NAT Router.  If it is indeed opened, make sure that it is for a legitimate purpose and is secured.  If you do not know why a port is open, you are better-of by closing it - this could be performed at the NAT Router / Firewall level.</p>
