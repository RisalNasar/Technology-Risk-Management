# Security Testing in the Agile World

<p>Traditionally, Security is thought about only at the last mile of a project timeline.  This is usually after the full set of UAT (User Acceptance Test) is completed, after which a Penetration Test would be performed by an External Penetration Test Service Provider.  Due to pressing timelines for Product Release, typically, plugging the security holes are done in a haphazard manner.  High and Medium rated vulnerabilities would be plugged through less thought-out workaround solutions, whereas Low rated items would typically be <i>Risk Accepted</i>.

<p>The above practice exists, even when people know that the cost of change increases exponentially over time.

<p><h3>Continuous Security Testing in the Agile World</h3>

<p> In the new world where projects are more-and-more adopting the Agile approach, or a combination of Agile and Waterfall, it is imperative that Security Testing is also embedded very deeply and from the start into the Development Methodology.
