# Security Testing in the Agile World

<p>Traditionally, Security is thought about only at the last mile of a project timeline.  This is usually after the full set of UAT (User Acceptance Test) is completed, after which a Penetration Test would be performed by an External Penetration Test Service Provider.  Due to pressing timelines for Product Release, typically, plugging the security holes are done in a haphazard manner.  High and Medium rated vulnerabilities would be plugged through quick workaround solutions, whereas Low rated items are typically <i>Risk Accepted</i>.

<p>The cost of change increases exponentially within a project timeline.
