# <p><strong><u>Best Practices for Organizing Your Work</u></strong></p>
<p>1)      <strong>Work Log Document</strong>: Keep a log of the main tasks that you have performed for the day.  It should show activities on which you have spent your time for the day.  This will help to justify why certain tasks were prioritized/de-prioritized.  It will also show how many items are present in your work basket.</p>
<p>2)      <strong>Next Steps Document</strong>: Keep a list of the next steps required for each project/work-stream  that you are handling.  Group them according to priority (importance/urgency).  This gives you oversight of your work.  It will also show how many items are present in your work basket.</p>
<p>3)      <strong>Portfolio and Management Update Document</strong>: Keep a document containing the list of all work in your work basket and the progress made so far.  This helps in providing updates to Management and also in seeking Management Support in cases of contention/road blocks.  Also completed work-streams/projects should be listed in the document to show your achievements till date.</p>
<p>4)      <strong>Easy Reference Document</strong>: The document should contain data (example: Contacts, team Distribution List, Commands, etc) that are referenced from time to time for Business-As-Usual.</p>
