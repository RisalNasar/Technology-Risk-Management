<p><u>Determine Places for Cameras</u></p>
<p>Cameras should be placed to capture activity surrounding:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Assets that are being protected - (Example: Servers, Network Devices, Workstations, Cash Register, etc).  These cameras would help to detect/prevent theft, destruction and tampering of assets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Choke Points that provide access to Assets that are being protected - (Example: Entry and Exit Doors, Staircase, etc).  These cameras help to provide a clearer and closer view of the perpetrator to assist with investigations.  They also help to get alerted of potential threat agents before they get access to the assets.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Determine Camera Types</u></p>
<p>Generally, there are three types of cameras:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed cameras - The view is locked on to a specific area.</li>
	<li>Mechanical Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) Cameras - The view can be manually adjusted by an operator, can capture great distances and can zoom in to capture specific details.  The system records only the current area viewed.</li>
	<li>Panoramic cameras – These cameras are capable of covering large area than fixed cameras.  They can capture details in a wider angle – 180, 270 and even an entire 360 degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guideline for choosing camera is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use fixed cameras if there is a very specific area of interest and there is no operator for watching video in real time.</li>
	<li>Use PTZ cameras if there is a large area of interest (way more than 30 square meters) and there is an operator available for watching the video in real time.</li>
	<li>Use Panoramic cameras if the area of interest is small (less than 30 square meters) and you do not have an operator watching in real time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Camera installation can be using the Analog Design approach or the IP Design approach.  Please refer <a href="http://www.discount-security-cameras.net/analog-vs-ip-technology.aspx">article</a> for more information on the differences between the two.</p>
<p><u>Determine Field of View for the Cameras</u></p>
<p>Determine the optimum Field of View (FoV) for the Cameras.  Make sure the camera is not too high, too left or right, too zoomed in or out.  Make sure that the camera is set up so it properly captures the target.</p>
<p><u>Verify with Customer and get Sign-Off</u></p>
<p>Prepare a map of the facility and mark the location of each camera on the map.  Take a photo of the place where the camera is planned to be mounted and mark the exact spot on the photo.  Take a photo of the approximate FoV of each camera.  Include all of these details in an Implementation Plan and submit to the customer for their signoff.</p>
<p>Finally, install the Cameras as per the Implementation Plan.</p>
