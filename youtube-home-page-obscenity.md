# Manage Youtube Home Page Obscenity
<p>Youtube is presenting very obscene videos in it's homepage (before user login).  This is probably due to the watching habit of the majority population where you live.  </p>
<p>In order to ensure that the obscene videos are not presented to you every time you try to use youtube, create a youtube bookmark to a safe channel.</p>
<p>Example:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ScienceChannel/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://www.youtube.com/user/ScienceChannel/videos</a> instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/</a></p>
