# Define Cloud Service
<p>When to classify a service as cloud service?</p>
<p>A service is classified as cloud when a company does not know where their data resides in the Service Provider’s servers (Production and DR instances are not fixed). This presents a risk as the company does not have sovereignty over their data and does not know the jurisdictions under which it operates.</p>
<p>If the client company is able to contractually restrict the Production and DR Datacenters where their data is hosted and processed and is able to mitigate any comingling risks, then the service provided do not fall under the category of “Cloud Computing”, even though the service provider may be calling the application they provide as a “cloud application”.</p>
