# Personal Password Management Guideline

<p>In today’s world, each individual needs to remember many passwords.  There is a password for the Windows network logon, e-mail accounts, online passwords (like website member account), SFTP passwords, etc. The list is endless. 
For true security, one should use different passwords for different accounts.  Because if the same password is used everywhere, and if that password gets leaked due to a hack on one of the accounts, all your accounts become exposed!!! The attacker would have access to your e-mail accounts, websites, bank accounts, etc!!!

<p>People in today’s workplace resort to store their passwords in text files or excel files.  They assume that if ‘only they know the specific file’ in which passwords are kept, then the passwords will be safe.  However, Security experts advise that ‘Security through Obscurity’ is not a good Security Principle. 

<p>Microsoft Excel do offer the ability to encrypt the document.  However, Excel encryption is deemed weak (version dependent).  Also, Excel is not custom made to support the features that a full-fledged Password Manager should offer.
