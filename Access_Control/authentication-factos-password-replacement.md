# Authentication Factors - Can Passwords Be Totally Replaced?

<p>There are three ways, in which a user could be authenticated to a system.  Based on:
	<ul>
		<li>What the user knows. Example: Passwords and passphrases.</li>
		<li>What the user has. Example: Mobile Phones, hardware token, etc.</li>
		<li>What the user is. Example: Fingerprint, retina scan, palm print, facial scan, etc.</li>
	</ul>


<p> Even though, password controls are often weak due to people using simple, easy to guess, repetitive passwords, passwords have their own merit in that they are something the user knows and can choose not to reveal to somebody, even in a lifethreatening scenario.  However, the other two authentication factors (what the user has and is) could be forcefully used without the consent of the user (example: While the user is unconscious, asleep or after physically overpowering the user).

<p>As such, <i><b>What the User Knows</b></i> authentication-factor should not be elimitated in an authentication control, but rather be complemented with <i><b>What the User Is</b></i> and <i><b>What the User Has</b></i> based authentication-factors.
